# 👋 Hi, I'm Alexander (aka Blue1)

I'm an aspiring **scientist-engineer** at the very beginning of my journey.  
Right now, I have zero experience — but a lot of drive to build myself from the ground up.

---

## 🔬 What I'm into:
- Technology, machines, and everything in between
- Creating tech and breaking it — hacking, modifying, reinventing
- Not just programming — also mechanics, electronics, and innovation
- DIY projects — the joy of making something personal, real, and **alive**
- Bringing art into tech — I draw, make music, and think creatively

---

## 🛠️ My goal:
To become a full-spectrum engineer — the kind who can **build, understand, and reimagine** the systems of tomorrow.

---

## 🌐 About Cupper:
I'm working on creating a community called **Cupper** — a space for innovation, research, and tech development.  
It’s about learning, experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible — together.
